Python note 2
-------------

### Loop

1. simple loop
    - use indentation to define things to be done for each item
        - tab (use four spaces)
2. enumerate(list)
3. zip(list1, list2)
4. dict.items()


### Updating a list in a loop

- create an empty list, called `new_list`
- create a list, `old_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- loop through each item of the `old_list`, and `print(item + 1)`
- loop through each item of the `old_list`, and append the `item + 1` to `new_list`


### Updating a dictionary in a loop

- create an empty dict, called `new_dict`
- create a list, `old_dict = ['a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5]`
- loop through each seet of `key` & `value` of the `old_dict`, and `print(value + 1)`
- loop through each seet of `key` & `value` of the `old_dict`, and update `new_dict` with the key and `value + 1`


## Task
