## Introduction

It's difficult to learn linux from scratch when you have no experience using
Linux. I'm running a training course about learning linux for neuroimaging for
people in PNL, and this repository includes example files and codes required
in the training. 

The recordings of each session will be uploaded in
https://www.youtube.com/c/KevinKangikCho.


## Requirements
- unix system (linux, mac, or ubuntu windows subsystem)



## How to run the code
Unless otherwise mentioned in the class, running the following lines in your
terminal will suffice.

```
# download the code 
git clone https://github.com/kcho/linux_tutorial tmp_linux_tutorial

# run the code
cd tmp_linux_tutorial
bash create_example.sh
```
